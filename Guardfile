# A sample Guardfile

# Note: The cmd option is now required due to the increasing number of ways
#       rspec may be run, below are examples of the most common uses.
#  * bundler: 'bundle exec rspec'
#  * bundler binstubs: 'bin/rspec'
#  * spring: 'bin/rsspec' (This will use spring if running and you have
#                          installed the spring binstubs per the docs)
#  * zeus: 'zeus rspec' (requires the server to be started separetly)
#  * 'just' rspec: 'rspec'
guard :rspec, cmd: 'zeus rspec' do
  # run every updated spec file
  watch(%r{^spec/.+_spec\.rb$})
  # run the lib specs when a file in lib/ changes
  watch(%r{^lib/(.+)\.rb$}) { |m| "spec/lib/#{m[1]}_spec.rb" }
  # run the model specs related to the changed model
  watch(%r{^app/(.+)\.rb$}) { |m| "spec/#{m[1]}_spec.rb" }
end

guard :bundler do
  # On gemfile update run bundle
  watch('Gemfile')
end
